Hey there, tech enthusiasts! Ever wonder what drives someone to dive headfirst into the world of technology? Well, grab a seat, and let me spill the beans on my journey. Trust me, it's been quite the ride!

## Curiosity: My Childhood Companion

You know how they say curiosity killed the cat? Well, in my case, it birthed a tech lover! Picture this: I'm 8 years old, and my dad brings home our very first family desktop. Where does he put it? Right in my room. Big mistake, Dad! (Or was it?)

One day, overcome by curiosity, I decided to play doctor with our poor, unsuspecting computer. I took it apart, piece by piece, determined to understand its innards. Putting it back together? Now that was the real challenge!

Imagine the panic when I hit the power button and... nothing. My heart raced as I frantically tried to figure out why it wouldn't turn on. It was my first taste of real-world problem-solving, fueled by the fear of my dad's wrath. When that PC finally booted up again? Pure. Ecstasy. I was hooked!

## Gaming: The Gateway Drug

As I grew older, my love for computers only escalate. Boredom? Install a new game! Lonely? Connect PCs with the neighbor kid and lose ourselves in Diablo. Sometimes, this meant bringing enormous PC towers and huge monitors to each other's houses. Talk about a workout!

## From Hobby to Passion

Computers were my constant companions. I'd spend hours surfing the web, learning how these magical machines worked. When it came time to choose subjects for my major exams in high school, IT and science stream were no-brainers for me.

## A Detour That Led Me Back

Life took an interesting turn in college. I dabbled in photography, graphic design, and illustration. But when financial troubles hit, I had to drop out and dive into the working world as a graphic designer.

Plot twist: My old boss asked me to create a website for his printing company. Suddenly, I found myself diving headfirst back into tech. WordPress, PHP, CSS, HTML – I was like a kid in a candy store, eager to learn it all!

## The Big Picture

Looking back, it all makes sense. Technology just clicks with me. It's like speaking a language I was born to understand. As we've entered the Information Age, my curiosity has only grown deeper. Every new problem is a puzzle waiting to be solved, and I'm all here for it!

That's my tech story – how I got here and why it means the world to me. It's been my anchor when I felt lost and my driving force when I stumbled. Cheesy? Maybe. But hey, it's my truth, and I'm sticking to it!
